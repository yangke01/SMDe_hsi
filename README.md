This project **heavily relies on the data loading and training framework of [HSIR](https://github.com/bit-isp/HSIR)**. We appreciate the excellent open-source work. 

ðŸ“Œ The model defined in `hybrid.py` is the one actually used during training.  
For better clarity and naming consistency, we also provide a cleaned-up and standardized version in `SMDe.py`.

ðŸ“¦ Pre-trained checkpoints and testing datasets can be downloaded from the following link:
